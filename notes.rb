# how to change numerical validation input before validation? ex price on product






# how to handle .env omniauth credentials for someone who wants to add to my app

# why does my page take so long to load.

# /////////////////What I did to make reviews ajax post work//////////////////
# 1. changed event hander on my filter form in products.js from $('form') to $('#searchForm')
# 2. removed javascript include tag from products/index (products.js was being rendered twice)
# 3. added datatype: 'script' to ajax post for new review
# ///////////////////////////////////



# why use ajax if I can just get my info using the model macros

# can I have to many javascript global variables?

# when the next page link is clicked it somehow disables the votes click handler
